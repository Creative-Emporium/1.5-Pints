In the first section, we define the paths to the input fastq files, the reference genome, and the output directory.\n2. We then define three rules: `align_reads`, `sort_and_mark_duplicates`, and `index_bam`.\n3. The `align_reads` rule takes paired-end fastq files as input and aligns them to the reference genome using BWA. The aligned reads are then sorted and converted to BAM format using Samtools. The rule produces a BAM file and a log file as output.\n4. The `sort_and_mark_duplicates` rule takes the BAM file produced by `align_reads` as input and sorts it by coordinate using Picard. The rule then marks duplicate reads and produces a new BAM file and a metrics file as output.\n5. The `index_bam` rule takes the marked duplicates BAM file produced by `sort_and_mark_duplicates` as input and produces a BAM index file as output.\n6. Finally, we define the workflow using the `samples` wildcard, which is derived from the input fastq files.

If not, you'll need to create the user account again using the following command:\n```bash\nsudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash g20940379-2022\n```\n1. Set the password for the `g20940379-2022` user:\n```\nsudo passwd g20940379-2022\n```\nEnter the desired password (e.g., \"Km2@22\") twice when prompted.\n\n1. Now, try switching to the `g20940379-2022` user account again:\n```\nsu g20940379-2022\n```\nEnter the password you just set when prompted.

After you have \u201cunshadowed\u201d the password and shadow file, remove any unnecessary accounts.\nIf you look inside the unshadow file you will find 60 different accounts. Most of these were created by the default installation of Kali\u2026and are not related to this assignment \u2013 so you can remove these.\n\nRemove lines 1-55. The first password you should have is for \u201cfrustrated employee\u201d.\n\nYou should also have the password for the cfinnigan account already; so you can remove the line that starts with \u2018cfinnigan.\n\nThis should leave you with the following users\u2026 \u201cfrustratedemployee\u201d, \u201cuser1\u201d, \u201cuser2\u201d, and \u201cuser3\u201d.\n\nBelow is some more insider information about the passwords. (uc = uppercase, lc = lowercase)\nUser1 -> 8 characters long (uc + lc)\nUser 2 -> 4 characters long (uc + lc + symbols)\nUser 3 -> 6 characters long (uc + lc + numbers + symbols, based on - but more complicated than User2)\nfrustratedemployee -> 6 characters long (uc + lc + numbers + symbols)\n\n2. Attack the weakest passwords first\nIn the configuration file for \u2018john\u2019 you will find different types of incremental approach. For example, [Incremental: Alphanum] has 52 characters (all uppercase and all lowercase).\nIf you change the configuration file so that the section for [Incremental: Alphanum] has a MinLen of 4 and MaxLen of 4 then you can issue the following command,\njohn --incremental=alphanum --format=md5crypt unshadowfile\n\nThis will attack the user1 password only.\nIf you change the [Incremental: ASCII] to a MinLen of 4 and a MaxLen of 4 then it will attack passwords for User1 and User2.\n\\*\\*\\*Note \u2013 you only need to include the passwords you are attacking in the unshadow file.\n\n3. Attack the stronger passwords next\nThe passwords for \u201cfrustratedemployee\u201d and \u201cuser3\u201d are both 6 characters long with uppercase, lowercase, symbols and numbers in the password \u2013 and they will take a lot longer to crack.\nBecause of this you only need to demonstrate HOW you will crack these passwords without actually having to crack them.\nIn your template file, provide the details of any configuration file changes so that it cracks a 6-character password with all the variants of the characters (lower, upper, symbols, numbers). Then issue the command to crack the password\u2026let it run for a few seconds, then press the Q button to quit. Make sure you provide a screenshot so that we can see you have issued the correct command.\n\n4. Part 6 isn\u2019t possible without accessing the original password and shadow files\nBecause you\u2019re not going to be cracking all the passwords, part 6 isn\u2019t possible. So\u2026let\u2019s make the assumption that you have cracked the password for your account during the previous step.

Provide possible explanation(s) for this.\n\u2022 Considering what you now know (intel) about how the password for cfinnigan is selected (2 words camel-capped), are you able to ssh into the Blue machine with the cfinnigan account?\n\u2022 Alternatively, are you able to ssh into any of the other accounts whose passwords you have successfully cracked?\n\nok but the jhon the ripper doesn't have Incremental Alphanum whaty else can be used instead of it, it's also used as an example.....", "role": "user"}, {"content": "You are correct that the hash type should be 500 for the Unix DES-based crypt, which is the default crypt in the passwd file.

Definition and recognition of resilience\n\nResilience is a vital life skill that enables individuals to adapt and cope with challenging situations effectively. It is the ability to recover from adversity, setbacks, trauma, and stress, which helps individuals to bounce back and thrive. Resilience is not a fixed trait but can be developed and strengthened through practice, coping mechanisms, and resilience-building techniques.\n\nIt's essential to have resilience because life is unpredictable, and everyone will face difficulties at some point. Resilient individuals can handle adversity with greater ease, are better equipped to deal with change, and can maintain their mental and physical health in the face of challenging situations.\n\nSome of the key characteristics of resilient individuals include adaptability, optimism, perseverance, self-awareness, and emotional regulation. They are open to new experiences, can think positively, persist in the face of challenges, and understand their emotions and reactions.\n\nResilience can manifest in different areas of life, such as work, relationships, and health. At work, resilient individuals can bounce back from setbacks, navigate change, and adapt to new situations. In relationships, they can communicate effectively, handle conflict, and maintain healthy boundaries. In terms of health, they can manage stress, take care of their physical health, and seek support when needed.\n\nExamples of resilience in action could include an individual who has lost their job due to COVID-19 but continues to job search and network, despite facing setbacks. Another example could be someone who has been through a difficult breakup but has learned from the experience, developed new coping strategies, and is open to new relationships in the future.

Step-by-step protocol to increase resilience\n\nBuilding resilience is a process that requires time, effort, and commitment. Here is a step-by-step protocol for building resilience:\n\nStep 1: Identify your strengths and weaknesses.\n\nTo become more resilient, it's important to have a clear understanding of your strengths and weaknesses. Take time to reflect on your past experiences and identify what has helped you cope in difficult situations. This can include things like a positive attitude, a support network, or effective problem-solving skills. It's also important to identify areas where you may struggle, such as managing stress or dealing with setbacks.\n\nStep 2: Set realistic goals.\n\nOnce you have a better understanding of your strengths and weaknesses, set realistic goals for building resilience. These goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). For example, a goal might be to practice mindfulness meditation for 10 minutes each day for the next month.\n\nStep 3: Practice self-care.\n\nSelf-care is an important part of building resilience. This can include things like getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and taking time to relax and recharge. It's important to prioritize self-care activities that work for you and that you enjoy.\n\nStep 4: Develop positive coping mechanisms.\n\nDeveloping positive coping mechanisms is key to building resilience. This can include things like journaling, practicing mindfulness, or engaging in creative activities. It's important to experiment with different coping mechanisms to find what works best for you.\n\nStep 5: Build a support network.\n\nHaving a strong support network is crucial for building resilience. This can include family, friends, colleagues, or a therapist. It's important to cultivate supportive relationships and to reach out for help when needed.\n\nStep 6: Practice resilience in everyday life.\n\nResilience is something that can be practiced and developed in everyday life. Look for opportunities to practice resilience in your daily routine, such as setting goals, facing challenges, or practicing gratitude. It's important to approach these opportunities with a growth mindset and to view setbacks as learning experiences.\n\nPutting the protocol into practice:\n\nTo put the protocol into practice, start by identifying one or two SMART goals that align with the six steps outlined above. For example, a goal might be to practice positive self-talk when facing a stressful situation. Then, break down the goal into manageable and achievable steps, such as practicing positive self-talk for five minutes each day for the next week. Finally, track your progress and make adjustments as needed.\n\nRemember that building resilience takes time and effort, but it's a skill that can be developed and strengthened over time.
